# Explaining how to obtain OSM data

To obtain OpenStreetMap (OSM) data for a specific region, go to the [OpenStreetMap website](https://www.openstreetmap.org/). Navigate to the map area of interest and select a bounding box by adjusting the rectangle on the map. The bounding box is defined by four coordinates: top (latitude of the northern edge), bottom (latitude of the southern edge), left (longitude of the western edge), and right (longitude of the eastern edge). These four numbers specify the region you want to export. Once defined, click the "Export" button to download the data in an OSM-compatible format, such as `.osm` or `.pbf`. This exported file can then be fed into an OSM engine (e.g., Osmosis or a custom parser) to retrieve specific features, such as roads, buildings, or amenities, for further analysis or application integration.

For example, the map above shows a portion of the New York region, and the bounding box is defined by the four numbers: top (40.725000), bottom (40.720000), left (-73.985000), and right (-73.980000). You can use these coordinates directly in the URBANO engine within Grasshopper for Rhinoceros to define the area of interest. By inputting these values, URBANO can retrieve and process OSM features such as buildings, roads, and green spaces for urban analysis and simulation tasks. This workflow allows seamless integration of real-world geospatial data into your design and analysis pipeline.

# Explaining how to apply OSM data in the URBANO to have the features, including the buildings, amenities, and streets

The diagram illustrates the workflow for using the URBANO plugin in Grasshopper to extract specific features, such as buildings, amenities, and streets, from OpenStreetMap (OSM) data. The process begins with **Pulling OSM data** (Step 1), where the user selects a region of interest using the bounding box coordinates (top, bottom, left, and right) from the OSM website. These coordinates define the exact area to be processed. In **Step 2**, the URBANO plugin retrieves specific features, including buildings, amenities, and streets, based on the OSM data for the selected region. Finally, in **Step 3**, the extracted features are "baked" into Grasshopper and Rhinoceros for further use in design and analysis. This seamless process integrates real-world geospatial data into urban planning and simulation tasks.

The image shows a schematic representation of the retrieved buildings from the selected region, based on the OSM data. Each building is represented in 3D, and the schematic also includes the footprints of the buildings. These footprints can be further utilized as a foundation for creating detailed Building Information Models (BIM) of the specific region. By leveraging these footprints, you can enhance the urban planning and architectural design process, enabling accurate modeling and analysis of the built environment.

The image compares **Dragonfly** and **Honeybee** models within the context of building energy simulation. The Dragonfly model (shown in the top-right corner) is a simplified representation of buildings, focusing on larger-scale, low-detail massing and zoning. It is used for urban-scale analysis or evaluating energy flows and loads for multiple buildings within a community. On the other hand, the Honeybee model (bottom-right corner) provides more detailed building representations, including individual zones, surfaces, and construction materials, enabling a higher-resolution energy analysis at the building or room level.

### Advantage of Dragonfly for Building Community Simulations:
Dragonfly excels in simulating energy flows for building communities due to its focus on simplified representations, which significantly reduces computational complexity and time. It is well-suited for large-scale analyses involving multiple buildings, where detailed modeling (as in Honeybee) is unnecessary or impractical. Dragonfly allows urban planners and energy analysts to assess energy performance, identify trends, and evaluate the impact of community-level design decisions quickly and effectively.
